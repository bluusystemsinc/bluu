FTDI sensor for CAIM

	$ lsmod | grep ftdi
	ftdi_sio               44771  0 
	usbserial              51132  1 ftdi_sio

To avoid using default driver ftdi driver in your system it's neccesary to run rmmod as root:
	$ sudo /sbin/rmmod ftdi_sio
This will allow the plugin to use the ftdi device.

If you are not running caim as root you will allow your user to have access to the usb device this error will be printed in stdout:
	libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/006/004: Permission denied.
To fix it run:
	sudo chown <your_user>:root /dev/bus/usb/006/004
